                We explore quality externalities on platforms: when buyers have limited information, a seller's quality affects whether her buyers return to the platform, thereby impacting other sellers' future business. We propose an intuitive measure of this externality, applicable across a range of platforms. <i>Guest Return Propensity</i> (GRP) is the aggregate propensity of a seller's customers to return to the platform. We validate this metric using Airbnb data: matching customers to listings with a one standard deviation higher GRP causes them to take 17\% more subsequent trips. By directing buyers to higher-GRP sellers, platforms may be able to increase overall seller surplus.

                In this note we consider a scenario where agents must make a binary choice about where to locate. They have
                heterogeneous preferences over locations. In addition, whichever
                location an agent chooses, his utility also includes an agglomeration
                effect that is increasing in the proportion of the population that
                chooses that location. Each individual is uncertain about the distribution
                of preferences in the population, but knows his own preferences, which
                serve as a noisy signal of population preferences.
                We show that if the marginal returns to agglomeration are sufficiently
                decreasing in the proportion of the population co-locating (returns are more concave
                than log) then there will be over-agglomeration in equilibrium, relative to the social optimum.  If the agglomeration
                function is less concave than log (for example, linear) there will
                be under-agglomeration in equilibrium.

                We analyze the financial value of insurance when individuals have access to credit markets. Loans allow consumers to smooth shocks across time, decreasing the value of the smoothing (across states of the world) provided by insurance.  We derive a simple formula for the incremental value of insurance and show how it depends on individual age, health, and income and on the features of available loans.  Our central contribution is to derive formulas for aggregate welfare that can be taken to data from typical studies of health insurance.  We provide both exact formulas that can be taken to data on the distribution of medical expenditures and income and an approximate formula for aggregate data on medical expenditure.  Using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey we illustrate how the incremental value of insurance is decreasing with access to loans.  For consumers in the sickest decile, access to a five-year loan decreases the incremental value of insurance by $338 (6%) on average and $3,433 (36%) for the poorest consumers.  We also find that our approximate formula is a reasonable proxy for the exact one in our data.

The recent rise of hybrid work poses novel challenges for synchronizing in-office work schedules. Using anonymized building access data, we quantified coattendance patterns among ~43k employees at a large global technology company. We used two-way fixed effects regression models to investigate the association between an employee’s presence in the office and that of their manager and teammates. Our analysis shows that employee in-person attendance was 29% higher when their manager was present. Moreover, a 1-SD increase in the share of teammates who were present yielded a 16% increase in the individual employee’s attendance. We also observed greater coattendance among employees who were recently hired, have a Corporate or Operations role, or work in shared office spaces. Thus, we find evidence of some voluntary alignment of work schedules. Companies could bolster such organic coordination by leveraging digital scheduling tools or providing guidance specifically aimed at increasing coattendance.

The COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the world to its core and has provoked an overnight exodus of developers who normally worked in an office setting to working from home. The magnitude of this shift and the factors 
that have accompanied this new unplanned work setting go beyond what the software engineering community 
has previously understood to be remote work. To find out how developers and their productivity were affected, 
we distributed two surveys (with a combined total of 3,634 responses that answered all required questions) weeks apart to understand the presence and prevalence 
of the benefits, challenges, and opportunities to improve this special circumstance of remote work. From 
our thematic qualitative analysis and statistical quantitative analysis, we find that there is a dichotomy of 
developer experiences influenced by many different factors (that for some are a benefit, while for others a
 challenge). For example, a benefit for some was being close to family members but for others having family 
members share their working space and interrupting their focus, was a challenge. Our surveys led to powerful 
narratives from respondents and revealed the scale at which these experiences exist to provide insights as to h
ow the future of (pandemic) remote work can evolve.

            The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused a rapid shift to full-time remote work for many information workers. Viewing this shift as a natural experiment in which some workers were already working remotely before the pandemic enables us to separate the effects of firm-wide remote work from other pandemic-related confounding factors. Here, we use rich data on the emails, calendars, instant messages, video/audio calls and workweek hours of 61,182 US Microsoft employees over the first six months of 2020 to estimate the causal effects of firm-wide remote work on collaboration and communication. Our results show that firm-wide remote work caused the collaboration network of workers to become more static and siloed, with fewer bridges between disparate parts. Furthermore, there was a decrease in synchronous communication and an increase in asynchronous communication. Together, these effects may make it harder for employees to acquire and share new information across the network.

               The Covid-19 pandemic dramatically changed how organizations worked. Microsoft was one of the first to ask employees to work from home (WFH). We developed an anonymous nightly diary study with 435 participants, and we learned about their experiences over the first 10 weeks of the WFH directive. We found the largest challenges were having too many meetings, feeling overworked, and physical and mental health. However, there were things to be grateful for, and many people were thankful for family, increased flexibility, their job, and their team. We also learned that the simple act of reflecting nightly during the study could be helpful: people who reported no gratitude were 22% (p-value=.000007) less likely to report being satisfied that day. Our management used the anonymized, aggregate data to create new programs (such as No Meeting Friday) to address these challenges. We then saw immediate feedback on these programs in the diaries and used that to inform future decisions.

        <div id="abTaxMatch" class="ab" style="display: none;">
            We analyze the effects of taxation in two-sided <i>matching markets</i>, i.e.~markets in which all agents have  heterogeneous preferences over potential partners.
            In matching markets, taxes can generate inefficiency on the allocative margin by changing who is matched to whom, even if the number of workers at each firm is unaffected.
            While the allocative inefficiency of taxation need not be monotonic in the level of the tax when transfers flow in both directions, we show that it is weakly increasing in the tax rate for markets in which workers refuse to match without a positive wage.
            <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            We introduce a renormalization that allows for an equivalence between markets with taxation and markets without taxation but with adjusted match values.
            We use our equivalence to show additional properties of matching markets with taxation and to adapt existing econometric methods to such markets.  We then estimate the preferences in the college-coach US football matching market and show through simulations of tax reforms that the true deadweight loss can differ dramatically from that measured without accounting for the preference heterogeneity of the matching market.
            <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            In addition to highlighting the potential for allocative distortions from taxation, our model provides a continuous link between canonical models of matching with and without transfers.

                Policymakers subsidizing health insurance often face uncertainty about future market prices. We study the implications of one policy response: <i>linking</i> subsidies to prices, to target a given post-subsidy premium. We show that these price-linked subsidies weaken competition, raising prices for the government and/or consumers. However, price-linking also ties subsidies to health care cost shocks, which may be desirable. Evaluating this tradeoff empirically using a model estimated with Massachusetts insurance exchange data, we find that price-linking increases prices 1-6%, and much more in less competitive markets. For cost uncertainty reasonable in a mature market, these losses outweigh the benefits of price-linking.

We report three main insights.  First, we observe that
                most people employ strategies consistent with Nash, at least some of the time.  Second, however,
                players strategically use information on previous play of their opponents, a non-Nash equilibrium behavior;  they are more likely to do so when the expected payoffs for such actions increase.  Third, experience matters:  players with more experience use information on their opponents more effectively than less experienced players, and are more likely to win as a result.  We also explore the degree to which the deviations from Nash predictions are consistent with various non-equilibrium models.  We analyze both a level-k framework and an adapted quantal response model. The <i>naive</i> version of each these strategies &#8211 where players maximize the probability of winning without considering the probability of losing &#8211 does better than the standard formulation.  While, one set of people  use strategies that resemble quantal response, there is another group of people who employ strategies that are close to k<sub>1</sub>; for naive strategies the latter group is much larger.

                Medical innovations have improved treatment for many diseases but have simultaneously raised spending on healthcare.
                Many health economists believe that technological change is the major factor driving the growth of the healthcare sector. Whether quality has increased as much as spending &#8211  that is, whether new innovations raise or lower quality-adjusted prices in health care &#8211  is a central question for both positive and normative healthcare analysis.   We do a systematic analysis of the impact of technological change on quality-adjusted prices, with over six thousand comparisons between innovations and incumbent technologies.
                We observe each innovation's price and quality, as well as the price and quality of an
                incumbent technology treating the same disease. We find that the innovations' quality-adjusted prices are higher than the incumbents' for about two-thirds  of innovations. Nevertheless, we argue that quality-adjusted prices may fall or rise over time depending on the effect of competition on incumbents' prices over time. A 4% price decline due to competition  would offset the cross-sectional price difference for a majority of indications. We discuss the conditions particular to healthcare that may cause increases in quality-adjusted prices over time rather than decreases as experienced in many other industries.

                We
                examine the profitability and implications of online discount
                vouchers, a relatively new marketing tool that offers consumers
                large discounts when they prepay for participating firms goods
                and services. Within a model of repeat experience good purchase,
                we examine two mechanisms by which a discount voucher service
                can benefit affiliated firms: price discrimination and
                advertising. For vouchers to provide successful price
                discrimination, the valuations of consumers who have access to
                vouchers must generally be lower than those of consumers who do
                not have access to vouchers. Offering vouchers tends to be more
                profitable for firms which are patient or relatively unknown,
                and for firms with low marginal costs. Extensions to our model
                accommodate the possibilities of multiple voucher purchases and
                firm price re-optimization. Despite the potential benefits of
                online discount vouchers to certain firms in certain
                circumstances, our analysis reveals the narrow conditions in
                which vouchers are likely to increase firm profits.

                Using
                information local to the premerger equilibrium, we derive
                approximations of the expected changes in prices and welfare
                generated by a merger. We extend the pricing pressure approach
                of recent work to allow for non-Bertrand conduct, adjusting the
                diversion ratio and incorporating the change in anticipated
                accommodation. To convert pricing pressures into quantitative
                estimates of price changes, we multiply them by the merger
                pass-through matrix, which (under conditions we specify) is
                approximated by the premerger rate at which cost increases are
                passed through to prices. Weighting the price changes by
                quantities gives the change in consumer surplus.

              Due to the “Great Remote Work Experiment” that began in March 2020 when workplaces around the world rapidly shut down, work is changing faster than it has in a generation. As many people now return to the workplace and begin to experiment with hybrid work, a range of different outcomes is possible. Thankfully, researchers at Microsoft and from around the world have been investigating evolving hybrid work practices and developing technologies that will address the biggest new challenges while taking advantage of the biggest new opportunities.​
	<p>
	This Microsoft New Future of Work Report 2022 summarizes important recent research developments related to hybrid work. It highlights themes that have emerged in the findings of the past year and brings to the fore older research that has become newly relevant. Our hope is that the report will facilitate knowledge sharing across the research community and among those who track research related to work and productivity. This research area is unfolding as rapidly as work is changing, and the purpose of this report is to help the community build on what has been learned this past year.​
	<p>
	Never before has there been such an opportunity to actively shape the future of work. With research and careful study, we can create a new future of work that is meaningful, productive, and equitable.

               The coronavirus pandemic not only caused a public health crisis, it also caused technological, social, and cultural disruption. This past year, people across the globe experienced a rapid shift to remote work that upended their existing practices and will have long-term implications for how work gets done in the future. Looking forward, we expect that some of those who used to work from offices will continue to work remotely, while others will adopt hybrid models that will involve a combination of working from the office and working remotely. The current moment presents a unique opportunity to understand the nature of work itself, to improve remote support for a range of work practices, and to use what we have learned through remote work to improve in-office and hybrid practices.
	<p>
As a company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more, it is vital that Microsoft understands the massive transition currently underway so that we can help our customers come through this challenging time stronger and more resilient. We are all right now participants in a giant, natural, uncontrolled remote work experiment from which Microsoft must learn. Just as research has been fundamental in developing ways to prevent and treat COVID-19, it is also fundamental to understanding and supporting evolving the sociotechnical work practices.
	<p>
At the start of the pandemic, researchers from across Microsoft formed an ongoing cross-company initiative to coordinate efforts with the goal of understanding the impact of remote work and identifying opportunities to support new working practices. The initiative consists of over 50 research projects conducted by teams that span a range of disciplines (including engineering, research, marketing, human resources, and facilities) and divisions (including Microsoft Research, Office, Windows, Azure, Xbox, GitHub, and LinkedIn). The projects employ many different methodologies, ranging from small-scale, formative interviews with customers to large-scale modeling exercises and even EEG measurements of electrical impulses in the brain.
	<p>
This report provides a synthesis of the findings from these many research projects. We believe it represents the largest compilation of research related to the pandemic's impact on work practices available to date. The findings highlight a number of acute challenges and suggest opportunities to develop new work practices that are more efficient, equitable, and energizing. Work will never again be the same. With care and effort, however, we hope to make it better.
